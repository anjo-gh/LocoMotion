# LocoMotion

LocoMotion is web-based live coding language for choreography and movement. With LocoMotion, one can activate and move 3D models and motion capture data, via live coding, with brief programming notations inspired by choreographic/dance vocabulary and notation.

LocoMotion is being developed as part of a research project lead by David Ogborn and Kate Sicchio, funded by the New Frontiers in Research Fund (Exploration stream) of Canada. Research assistants contributing to the project, at both McMaster University and Virginia Commonwealth University, are: Shaden Ahmed, Ashmeet Dhaliwal, Fatima Ghaderi, Milica Hinic, Misha Joao, Esther Kim, Raahil Mahetaji, Saiara Mashiat, Karthyayani Ramesh, and Vic Wojciechowska.

We hesitate to document the language much at this point, as the notations are very much in flux - it is entirely possible that something that works in the language now would be removed at a moment's notice as we experiment with different possibilities. That said, enthusiastic onlookers may be able to intuit some of the possibilities from the demo program in the standalone at https://dktr0.github.io/LocoMotion or from videos that appear in this youtube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1r62fG6fHM&list=PLz3wq0ad0gSYc0NhFG2ucAdnttFy5a99K

LocoMotion is free-and-open-source software, released under the terms of the GNU Public License, version 3. In addition to the abovementioned standalone, it can be used in the Estuary collaborative live coding platform at https://estuary.mcmaster.ca. (Place the text ##locomotion in the first line of an Estuary code panel, with no language selected, to access LocoMotion.)
